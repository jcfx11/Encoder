A very simple use of an AS5600 absolute encoder to read an angle and translate that angle to a flap setting displayed on a small oled display.

Builds on the work of Scott and Rob Tillart

Needs hands on coding to calibrate and tailor the angles read to the display

Further coding to be added to the project, still a work in progress
